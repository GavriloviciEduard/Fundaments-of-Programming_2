A math teacher needs a program that helps students perform different vector operations.
The program manages several vectors and allows students to use the following features offered by the program:

  1. Scalar operations
    a. Add a scalar to a vector
      e.g. [1,2,3] + 2 = [3,4,5]
      
  2. Vector operations
    a. Add two vectors
      e.g. [1,2,3] + [4,5,6] = [5,7,9]
    b. Subtract two vectors
      e.g. [1,2,3] - [4,5,5] = [-3,-3,-2]
    c. Multiplication
      e.g. [1,2,3] * [4,5,5] = 29

  3. Reduction operations
    a. Sum of elements in a vector
      e.g. for [1,2,3] sum is 6
    b. Product of elements in a vector
      e.g. for [1,2,3] product is 6
    c. Average of elements in a vector
      e.g. for [1,2,3] average is 2
    d. Minimum of a vector
      e.g. for [1,-2,3] minimum is -2
    e. Maximum of a vector
      e.g. for [1,2,-3] maximum is 2
